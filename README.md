# Webpage-Timeout-Extension
A chromium based extension when enabled allows you to add websites or webpages to it using its popup.
When you visit the webpage after adding its url to the popUp,  the extension activates for that website and displays a  popup asking you to select the amount of time 
you would like to stay on this webpage for.
The pop WILL NOT disappear until you select one of the 3 options.
THE OPTIONS ARE ARE:  5 ------ 10 ------ 15
Meaning You can stay on the webpage for 5, 10 or 15 minutes.
IF you are still on the webpage after the selected time is over. The extension automatically closes the tab and sets a cooldown of 15.
IF you try to go to the webpage again before the cooldown is over, then the tab or webpage simply closes immediatly.
This was made to help ppl that are trying to limit their screen time but are failing to do so.

THERE ARE A COUPLE OF ISSUES WITH ADDING MULTIPLE URLS TO THE EXTENSION BUT ITS A WORK IN PROGRESS.
